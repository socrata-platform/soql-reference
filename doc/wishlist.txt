More position info on AST nodes

Replace TableName with something sane

VALUES source form

Statement in FROM in source form

Window function parsing overhaul

Rewrite "a |> b" into a CTE rather than a direct subselect
 - this is to make "select x union select x from @this" less duplicatey

Allow non-leaf queries on the RHS of |>
 - currently denied by parser
 - also figure out predecence etc.
 - I think right now it's "|>" is lower-predecence than table ops, all table
   ops are the same precedence and.. left associative?

OrderedMap -> ListMap

Unaliased `FROM @this`

Get rid of unused types (esp SoQLMoney) - maybe not date/time though?
